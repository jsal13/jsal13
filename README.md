I'm a Data Scientist / Software Engineer in Chicago.

#### :sleeping_bed: What kind'a stuff do I like to work with?

- **Math**: Stats, Linear Algebra, Multi/Single var Calc, all that fun applied stuff.
- **Data**: Big into open data, hard-to-parse data, cryptic (!!) data, etc.  Both creating dbs / data warehouses for it and doing analysis on it.  Data's the future, y'all.
- **Devops Stuff**: AWS, GCP.  Containerization, Pipelining.  Depending on the project, I like to have my things either living in a container or have a terraform to build it up on AWS.  It's important to have a model-to-deploy pipeline in data science!
- **Gamedev**: A new one!  I started on gamedev during a sabbatical I took in 2021, mostly focusing on Unity.  I messed around with Godot, GameMaker, and a few others, but Unity felt right.  My gamejam games can be found <a href="https://melat0nin.itch.io">at itch.io</a>.  They're not great but, you know, baby steps.

#### :zzz: What math did I study?

I studied algebraic topology in grad school which was pretty fun.  Lots of categorical stuff that was neat to mess around with.  It's been a few years out, but I'm trying to keep up by looking at what they've been doing with Topological Data Analysis these days.
