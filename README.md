I'm a Machine Learning Engineer in Chicago.

<a href="https://jsalv.com">Here's my personal site</a>.

<b>tl;dr</b>: I've worked with a bunch of data making models, I've built architecture to support data science from ingesting data to monitoring production models, and I've been enjoying doing math-y and machine learn-y stuff.
